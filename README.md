# cu-webring
A webring for Computer Science and Software Engineering students at Carleton University

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/simcard0000/se-webring and https://github.com/leofalvo/mcgillcswebring.org. 

## Features/Notes
- Should randomize sites such that people at bottom can be seen at top
- https://www.fusejs.io/getting-started/installation.html#direct-script-include
- Do not use react or npm. This site should be built as lightweight and robust as possible
- Keys: Full Name, Year Admitted into Carleton, Website URL
